## About The Project
This Project will have 3 different N-back tasks each designed to touch a different aspect of the working memory. 2 of them are Visual and 1 is auditory. 

1. Visual-verbal
    - For this experiment, participants will see a letter and have to do the N back task based on this.  
      - 0-back = press left CTRL for the letter "X", press right CTRL for any other letter  
      - 1-back = press left CTRL if the previous letter is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same  
      - 2-back = press left CTRL if the letter, 2 trials ago, is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same  

2. Visual-non-verbal
    - For this experiment, participant will see a square and have to do the N-back task based on the location
      - 0-back = press left CTRL if the square is in the top right corner, press right CTRL for any other location  
      - 1-back = press left CTRL if the previous square was in the same place current one, press right CTRL when it was not the same  
      - 2-back = press left CTRL if the location of the square, 2 trials ago, is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same.  
      
3. Auditory 
    - For this experiment, participant will hear letter being said out loud
      - 0-back = press left CTRL for the letter "X", press right CTRL for any other letter  
      - 1-back = press left CTRL if the previous letter is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same  
      - 2-back = press left CTRL if the letter, 2 trials ago, is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same. 



## Getting Started

There is only 1 sequence file if you download this repo. Use the matlab script to create more and change the presentation code (line 8 and 9 in each of the PCL files)
``` 
#string file_path = direc + "sequences//" + printf(random(1,50),"n-back_sequence_%d.txt");
string file_path = direc + "sequences//" + printf(1,"n-back_sequence_%d.txt");
```
*Need to be*
``` 
string file_path = direc + "sequences//" + printf(random(1,50),"n-back_sequence_%d.txt");
#string file_path = direc + "sequences//" + printf(1,"n-back_sequence_%d.txt");
```
Like this it will choose randomly between the 50 sequence files. These files are all semi random with the rule that there are always at least 2 no-target trails between targets. It also makes sure that 80% of the trials are non-target trials

## this needs to be upgraded to at least 3 non-targets, it gets more diffecult for the 2-back tasks


### Presentation settings

Add here all the presentation settings. We haven't tested it so no info as of yet. There should be print screens of the settings 


## Info about the paradigm  

### Stimuli
The stimuli are all created by ourselves. 

### Logfiles  
Logfiles with experiment reaction times and other information automatically should be placed in the logfile folder. In these logfiles you will find the behavioral information of each time the experiment is ran.  

### Sequences  
In the Presentation Files folder you'll find the experiment and the sequences that are semi-randomized, so we are sure that there are no 2 target trials in a row and how many trials there are. These sequences are made so that there are always non-target trials before a target trial.  

### Instructions  
1. Visual-verbal
    - For this experiment, participants will see a letter and have to do the N back task based on this.  
      - 0-back = press left CTRL for the letter "X", press right CTRL for any other letter  
      - 1-back = press left CTRL if the previous letter is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same  
      - 2-back = press left CTRL if the letter, 2 trials ago, is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same  

2. Visual-non-verbal
    - For this experiment, participant will see a square and have to do the N-back task based on the location
      - 0-back = press left CTRL if the square is in the top right corner, press right CTRL for any other location  
      - 1-back = press left CTRL if the previous square was in the same place current one, press right CTRL when it was not the same  
      - 2-back = press left CTRL if the location of the square, 2 trials ago, is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same.  
      
3. Auditory 
    - For this experiment, participant will hear letter being said out loud
      - 0-back = press left CTRL for the letter "X", press right CTRL for any other letter  
      - 1-back = press left CTRL if the previous letter is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same  
      - 2-back = press left CTRL if the letter, 2 trials ago, is the same as the current one, press right CTRL when it is not the same.
